# Loopy Math

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/upperlinecode/loopy-math-javascript-iteration)](https://repl.it/github/upperlinecode/loopy-math-javascript-iteration)

## TL;DR

This lab will give you practice with `for` loops. Open up loops.js, where the challenges are written as javascript comments. Run the code after each new loop you write to see if your code works as intended.

## Intro

Javascript can be used to make mathematical tasks much less... well... mathy. Use `for` loops to compute some of these math challenges without having to add hundreds of numbers by hand.

## The Lab

Loops in javascript allow us to automate processes that would be tedious and exhausting otherwise.

Without loops, printing 100 different numbers would take 100 lines of code. With loops, we can do it in 3 lines of code. More impressively, we can bump that number up to 10,000, or even into the millions and billions without having to add extra lines of code.

Open up the loops.js file, and try to complete each of the `for` loops described there. 

## Extra Help

Here's the easiest answer for problem 1:
```javascript
for(let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}
```

Many of the challenges can be done in at least two ways, and some can be done in as many as 10 ways, so as long as your output meets the criteria for each problem, you're doing great!

## Stretch

There are stretch activities built right into this lab.
